  Resources:
  I used IAT 235 class notes where we learned HTML I also refered back to this 
  https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_classes.asp specially for the classes and id as 
  i completely forgot these. Other than that i also just watched the labs. I occasionally 
  searched up things like what is the best way to represent lists.
